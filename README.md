# Synthetic Developer Documentation

This repository contains documentation served at **[https://dev.synthetic.new/](https://dev.synthetic.new/)**.

## 🚀 Overview

This is a subtree ripped directly from our internal monorepo. The files are kept in sync with our main repository through GitHub Actions workflows.

## ⚠️ Development Notes

**The development experience currently isn't great:** there's no way to test changes due to dependencies with our primary application, and there's no way of knowing what dependencies are available.

We're working to improve the experience, but we still hope that providing the source will allow users to contribute fixes and improvements to docs.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome any simple fixes and improvements.

If you'd like to make a more substantial change, such as contributing a new page, we really appreciate it! You can reach out on [Discord](https://synthetic.new/discord) as a check to avoid wasted effort, but we generally welcome any PRs or ideas that make the docs better for other users.

Thanks!
