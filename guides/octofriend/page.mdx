# Octofriend by Synthetic

[Octofriend](https://github.com/synthetic-lab/octofriend) is a small, helpful, zero-telemetry, cephalopod-flavored coding assistant created by Synthetic.

Octo works with any OpenAI-compatible or Anthropic-compatible API and allows you to switch models at will mid-conversation.

export const quickStartExamples = [{
  title: "Full command",
  language: "bash",

  language: "bash",

## Key Features

### Zero Telemetry
Octofriend has zero telemetry. Combined with Synthetic's privacy-focused approach, your code stays completely private.

### Model Switching
Switch between different models mid-conversation when one gets stuck.

### Thinking Token Management
Octofriend carefully manages thinking tokens for reasoning models like GPT-5 and Claude 4, ensuring optimal performance even with encrypted content.

### Auto-fix Models
Octofriend can use Synthetic's custom-trained models to automatically handle tool call and code edit failures:
- [diff-apply model](https://huggingface.co/syntheticlab/diff-apply) - Applies code diffs intelligently
- [fix-json model](https://huggingface.co/syntheticlab/fix-json) - Fixes malformed JSON responses
